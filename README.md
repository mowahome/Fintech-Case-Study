* **Blend Labs Inc (Blend)**

___
* Blend was incorporated in 2012 in San Francisco, CA.
* It was founded by Erin Collard, Eugene Marinelli, Nima Ghamsari, and Rosco Hill.
* The idea for the company came about from one of the founders, Nima Ghamsari, working at Palantir in 2008 where he was assigned to a team that was helping big banks find data-driven ways to amend loans that were in default and at risk for foreclosure. Nami quickly realised the behemoth mortgage industry was mostly run on paper with antiquated software providers and saw the need for a modern platform. This became the impetus for Nima and a few of his Palantir colleagues to leave and launch Blend.
###
>"Ghamsari also saw the clunkiness of the consumer side of the mortgage experience firsthand around five years ago when he was shopping for one. One bank emailed him PDF forms which he had to print, fill out and scan before sending back to the bank. "I replied that I don't have a printer or scanner and my handwriting is unreadable; I'm not gonna do this," he said. Ghamsari also frowns on the process of closing escrow, which typically involves having homebuyers go over and sign a thick stack of documents".

* Blend is funded primarily through venture capital funding from investors. In June 2019, the company raised $130 million in Series E Funding through Temasek and General Atlantic, and in 2020, an additional $75 was raised in series F financing led by Canapi Ventures. And more recently in January 2021, they raised $300 million in series G funding. Overall, Blend has raised $665 million through seed, series A-G funding prior to their IPO debut.

## Business Activities
* Blend is utilizing a data-driven approach that is more transparent and streamlines the mortgage origination and closing processes, leveraging data that banks already have access to such as income data, bank account information, and payments to make lending decisions in real time. It offers white-label techonology which powers mortgage applications on the websites of traditional lending firms such as banks and credit unions. This software efficiency in turn allows for higher mortgage volume processing without needing to hire additional staff in a much shorter time frame.
* The company's intended customer is financial services firms, particularly mortgage lenders. Its main client pool has grown to over 330 financial service providers.
* Blend is utlizing cloud-based platform that allows for seamless flow between banking services and products which are traditionally siloed. Blend also uses PHP, NGINX, and underscrore application and data systems.

## Landscape:
* Blend is in the lending domain of the financial industry.
* In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, large lenders started to confer hundred of billions in mortgages to third-party servicers. Consequently, these servicers needed help with managing their massive new portfolio. Major trends and innovations in this domain in the last 5-10 years have centered on creating technological advanced solutions that simplify mortgage applications.
* Other major companies in this domain include Rocket mortgage, quickenloans, better.com, Roostify, Lending tree, and Maxwell. 

## Results
* Blend now provides its digital infrastructure to more than 287 US banks. In 2020, its software was used to process nearly $1.4 trillion in mortgage and consumer loans, with a daily average volume of $5 billion processed by Blend's customers which is nearly 3 times the previous year, and its revenue doubled to $100 million. 
* Some of the core metrics that companies in this sector measure success by is the amount of time reduced in processing mortgage applications, and the volume of applications processed. Blend has simplified the mortgage application, underwriting, and closing process by saving an average of 7.3 days and $520 in operational costs per loan. Blend integrates with Plaid to check on bank accounts, CoreLogic to check for credit scores, and Google maps for location data which enables some banks for offer home buyers tentative mortgage approvals in real time.
* Relative to its competitors in the same domain, Blend serves as a software as a service, charging banks for use of their software in comparison to similar non bank companies that service mortgage processes directly.

## Recommendations
* I would suggest Blend to incorporate blockchain integrated lending software platform as well. This would allow for digitcal currency transactions as well as tokenization of real estate assets.
* Offering a blockchain powered service would attact more financial firms that transact in cryptocurrency, reducing the risk of fraud, cyber threats, simplify the transmission of data and reduce transaction times without limits by banks. Offer instant validation with real time data. This could open up Blend's clientele to include appraisers, real estate investors and asset management companies and increase overall market demand for such services. 
* This additional service would utilize smart contracts and distributed ledger technology.
* These technologies are appropriate for the solution as smart contracts do not require the intervention of third parties thus creating speed and efficiency and secures all information to prevent modification.
